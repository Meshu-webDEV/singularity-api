## Singularity-events-api

https://api.singularity.events/v1

A platform for organizing gaming tournaments. Worked on it individually from A to Z, back-to-front. 
From brainstorming to designing to developing and implementing to deployment. 

The platform has everything a real production-level, and feature-rich platform need. 
OAuth provider authentication, local authentication, email verification, account activation, tournament initiating/updating/starting/ending, integration with Twitch and Discord, Crowd-sourced templating system, rich search functionality, CRON jobs, a URL shortener, and much more.
